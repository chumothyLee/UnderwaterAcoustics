                        I am a third year undergraduate at UCSD majoring in Computer Science.  I am interested in continuing my education in graduate school, where I hope to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and its applications with robotics.  Iâ€™m very passionate about cat videos, and hope to one day command a capital ship in Star Citizen.

                       I'm a 3rd year Computer Science major with a minor in Environmental Studies; I want to apply my knowledge in Computer Science to real world applications, specifically in finding methods to better the health of our environment. Fun fact about me is that I spend lots of time watching YouTube videos and spend hours listening to indie/alternative music.

                        I am a third year Computer Science major at UCSD.  I have experience working with iOS and mobile app development.  When I'm not programming, I like to go to the gym to work out and stay strong, watch workout videos, and I enjoy cooking.

                      I am currently a third year Computer Science major at UCSD.  I am interested in front-end development and object-oriented design. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, going to the beach, eating, and watching my favorite shows.
